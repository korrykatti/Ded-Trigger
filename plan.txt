So my stupid brain instead of focusing on school study decided to help this guy out
By doing this all thing i might fail JEE my brain knows this but still tells to go on


# The easy part :
saying it will be easy to make

# The hard part
Finding how much time user has been offline



## HOW IT WILL WORK
so here is the plan ( i am not claiming i am the first one to do this also there is a reason i have made it open source)

DONT STEAL THE IDEA OR ME WILL KEEL YU

Yems me eez a supid keed

1) First the program will be kept running in a 99.9% uptime server
2) It will be constantly monitor a specific ip or something like that discord id to check there uptime ( ip is a bad idea if we die our sibling use internet and they nasty and computer stupid will think we online)
3) So it will keep monitoring and lets assume you pass out ( pains )
4) Then ur id will be showing offline and the program will be storing that in a database which will be private ofc
5) If it records you offline for more than 30 days it will trigger a function to send a message to your social accounts dming everyone
6) Yes u have to give social credentials ofc it would be store in your pc not with me 
7) Privacy issue solved + Your online friends will know when u die
